The growing global emphasis on sustainable transportation has led to an increasing demand for electric vehicles (EVs). 
However, consumers face challenges in choosing the most suitable EV model due to wide variations in performance, efficiency, range, and price across brands. 
This dataset — containing detailed information on 103 electric car models, including specifications such as acceleration, top speed, driving range, energy efficiency, charging capabilities,
drivetrain type, body style, seating capacity, and price — provides an opportunity to analyze and understand the key factors influencing electric vehicle performance and market positioning. 
The objective of this study is to explore trends and correlations among technical specifications and pricing,identify the most efficient and cost-effective models, and provide insights to support manufacturers,
policymakers, and consumers in making informed decisions regarding electric mobility.
